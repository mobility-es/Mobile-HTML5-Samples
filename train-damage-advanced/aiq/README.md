In this directory should be copied the Core API library, plus the framework files inside subfolder "app".

The contents should then look like this:

+-- app
¦   +-- images  // folder with images referenced by css file
¦   +-- scss    // Sass mixins and variables you may find useful when developing your application
¦   +-- framework.css
¦   +-- framework.js
+-- api.js
